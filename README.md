# FeastFinder üç±
FeastFinder is a webapp that helps people find new recipes, especially when
they don't know what to make. Simply put in the ingredients that you have available,
and we will present you with a list of recipes, sorted by relevance, that you might
be able to cook. Logging in will save your ingredients for future browsing!

## How to Run
To run the site, a GCP key is required (available upon request) to access our database of curated recipes. 
Save the key as `key.json` in the root directory of this repository. Then, run `npm run start-frontend` and 
`npm run start-backend` in two separate terminals. The site will be available at `localhost:3000`

## Project Contributors
Nicholas Springer and Peter Li

Project development was done mostly using pair programming, so each contributor contributed 
around half of each component.
