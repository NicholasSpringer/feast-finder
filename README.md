[Try the app here!](https://feast-finder-app.herokuapp.com/)

FeastFinder is a webapp that helps people find new recipes, especially when
they don't know what to make. Simply put in the ingredients that you have available,
and we will present you with a list of recipes, sorted by relevance, that you might
be able to cook. Logging in will save your ingredients for future browsing!
